# Drago Client

This is where the Drago client goes. It'll run locally on the users machine that they want to host the software on, it will hold an api key and basic config, it will query the DragoAPI every 5 minutes (or maybe longer idk)

Goals:

- Make it small
- Make it simple
- Make it secure

Data sent:
  API key
  IP address
  TImestamp of when sent
